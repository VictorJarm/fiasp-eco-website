            <p><b>BEESWAX WRAPS BY YULIA & VIKTOR:</b> Non plastic food wraps, organic natural alternative to plastic wrap for food storage. <p><b>OUR STORY:</b> Yulia is an Environmental Scientist and Viktor is a Civil Engineer - we have both been working in the consultancy industry for a combined 10 years and decided to help You and every Earth-conscious individual (not just large corporations!) be in charge of making Our Planet a better and more sustainable place for all. We have just started out on our new journey and we are making the Beeswax Wraps at our home, just the two of us.
