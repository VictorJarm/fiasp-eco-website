              <div>Victor is a civil engineer and he has spent nearly 4 years designing and building bridges and as well as monitoring concrete on site. Designing things to last, and conserving resources is Victor-engineer's main passion at work and beeswax wraps is his way of allowing people and households, not only engineering firms, play an important role in making our planet a cleaner place. <p></p> Victor remembers: as he as growing up his parents afforded themselves a first powerful "Western" (non-soviet) Vacuum cleaner. Victor's weekly help-around-the-house task was to hoover the whole flat. After about 2 years of use, the pipe slowly started tearing and it became  unbearable. Viktor and his dad had a chat: <p></p>Victor: "Dad, can we just buy a new pipe?" <br>Dad: "No, manufacturer doesn't produce them, we just want us to buy a new hoover..."<br>Victor: "Oh no, but we have no money, that's not fair!"<br>Dad: "Well, the best we can do is just get a few rods and a duct tape son"<p></p>And so they did, but the thought of creating and owning quality possessions and products tha last never left Victor. Beeswax wraps is his way of allowing individuals play the key role in minimising the use of our resources and minimising the use of throw-away plastic whilst enjoying quality product which lasts </div>
